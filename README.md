### Stock Sentiment Project
This project is based on the idea that Tweets about companies will be related, and may precede, to the stock price of that company.

The idea is two-fold:
1. The Tweets and stock price share a common cause: the state of the company. If Macbooks are exploding all over the world, Apple stock will tank because people believe it has released a product that will lose them money, and people will trash Apple on Twitter (and elsewhere) because of the terrible product.
2. Tweets may, to a small extent, drive stock price. If people see a ton of negative Tweets about Apple, they may decide to sell stock. If people see positive Tweets, they may choose to buy stock.

At the moment, this project consists only web-scraping files which I am running on my Raspberry Pi to gather enough data to test the above hypothesis.

Once I have enough Twitter and stock data, I will choose a model with which to explore the relationship between the sentiment of Tweets about a company and that company's stock price over time.
